# What is Ada?

Ada stands for Ada Lovelace Centre Data Analytics. It is a cloud-based data analysis platform which enables scientists to access a virtual environment powered by the digital research infrastructure  via a web browser.
Ada provides scientists the capabilities for data analysis, accessing experiment data, running software tools, sharing their working environment, uploading, and downloading data for publication.

## Ada for ISIS

Ada (known as IDAaaS) was rolled out to ISIS during 2020. It supports 10 scientific research groups, analysing data from 34 instruments using more than 70 different software tools, including MATLAB, Mantid, Horace, SASview etc.

## Ada for CLF

Ada (known as CDAaaS) was rolled out to CLF during 2021. It has been supporting scientists in Gemini and Artemis groups their experiment data analysis. It also supported Vulcan for their training.

## Ada for Training

We support training related to research software and conferences, for example:

- [Nov 16 - 25 , 2021 ISIS Virtual Reflectivity Training Course](https://indico.stfc.ac.uk/event/355/)
- [June 6 - 10, 2022 Daresbury DFTB+ School](https://www.cecam.org/workshop-details/1163)
- [June 29th â€“ July 1st, 2022 MDANSE 2022](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/MDANSE-2022.aspx)

## Ada with GPU

Scientists in ISIS are using ada as their primary platform for data analysis and it is mission critical to provide such an environment, such as GPU capabilities to enable their scientific work.

Ada provides virtual machines with GPUs for four scientific groups in ISIS. Without this environment, it is impossible for them to analyse their data with their software, such as Mantid Imaging, SASview and others.

Mantid Imaging requires 1 GPU for tomographic 3D volume reconstruction. Image analysis (e.g. with the Avizo package) requires as many GPUs as possible for volume rendering, prompt on-screen image manipulations and application of advanced compute-intensive filter algorithms.
For SASview, GPU environment can bring up to a factor 50x in speed improvement which is the difference between being able to analyse data or not. The micromagnetic simulation package Mumax3 also demands a GPU.

Without GPU environments, all above analysis would not be possible.

We are funded by the Scientific Computing Department and Ada Lovelace Centre.
