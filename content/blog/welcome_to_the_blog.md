## About

This is a general help page to explain the sections on the left. For more help on our services see the links above, or click on Help  for access to specific help for that section of the site.

## Workspaces

Here you can create specialised Workspaces for data analysis. Each Workspace is tailored to your experiments and its relevant workflows. You can access your raw data and Experiment directories. Files saved to your Home or Experiment directories will persist if you delete your Workspace. You may rename, delete, or share your Workspace with other users.

## Data

In the Data section you can transfer files to and from your Home and Experiment directories. This allows you to transfer files to and from your Workspace.

## Experiments

See your experiments and access the raw experiment data. Local Contacts and Principal Investigators may manage participants here.

## Maintenance

Shows planned maintenance periods when the service will either be at risk or unavailable.
