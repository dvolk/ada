## About

The Experiments section shows you information about any experiments that you are associated with.

## I can't see my experiment

If you are missing an experiment, please contact your Local Contact or the Principal Investigator and ask them to add you.

## How do I add someone to an experiment?

If your experiment role is a Local Contact or Principal Investigator you will have an extra option visible when you view experiment information. You will see the extra  button which will take you to the Edit Participants section. You can only add or remove participants with the Viewers role. To add a user, you will need to provide their email address - the address they used to register with the User Office.
