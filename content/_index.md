# What is Ada?

Here you can create specialised Workspaces for data analysis. Each Workspace is tailored to your experiments and its relevant workflows. You can access your raw data and Experiment directories. Files saved to your Home or Experiment directories will persist if you delete your Workspace. You may rename, delete, or share your Workspace with other users.

# How to access Ada?

Hopefully there should always be Workspaces available, but if there aren't any, please wait 10-15 minutes and try again. If all the Workspaces have been taken, it takes a few minutes to create some more. If there are still no Workspaces available, please contact supportanalysis@stfc.ac.uk
